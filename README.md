## Usage
    type in `./math` when you have the binary in your directory

    where you can start typing your math expressions

## Syntax

    - brackets
    you can use `() [] {}`

    - operators
    you can use `+ - * / ^`

    - functions
    for now you can use `log(base=10, n) pow(x, y) mod(x, y)`
